// This file is for adding interactive behavior to your website.
// For now, we'll keep it simple to get you started.

// This is a common practice that ensures your code only runs after the HTML has finished loading.
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    // This will log a message to your browser's developer console.
    // To see it, right-click on your webpage, select "Inspect", and then go to the "Console" tab.
    console.log('script.js loaded: The website is ready for interactivity!');

    // You can add your own JavaScript code here to make things happen on the page.
    // For example, you could add code to:
    // - Make elements appear or disappear
    // - Change text when a button is clicked
    // - Validate a form before it's submitted
    // - Create a photo gallery or carousel
});
